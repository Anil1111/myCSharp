# C# tips

**A C# class is a section of code that performs specific tasks, a blueprint for creating 
other objects.**

**We breakdown our app into classes and then compile them together.**

**The program.cs class is the entry point for our app, through the Main() method.**

**Each class gets its own file.**

**Now we have a class that does something, we can invoke that class in program.cs.**

**Within program.cs, we invoke a new instance of the GradeBook class.**

**GradeBook book = new GradeBook();. This is a constructor that will help us define parameters for the 
new gradeBook.**

**Encapsulation allows us to work with objects without understanding every aspect of how its used.**

**Public, private, static -- Access Modifiers.**

**Apply static to a method or field when: Statics can be used without creating a class.**

_e.g. public static float MinimumGrade = 0;_

**void - used to specify the method returns nothing.**
